                        <p>We have developed a proprietary Lead distribution/management CRM that we will give you log in credentials to access your leads that we live call transfer deliver to you.  The purpose of this web portal is used for several things: 1. For you to have access to your leads, view them and print them etc. 2nd, you will have the ability to approve or decline each and every lead based on whether it met the criteria that we set up with you in advance of starting your campaign, this creates accountability from us to generate and supply you with a high quality lead that meets the criteria or it is not a billable lead and we replace the lead. Thirdly, we can integrate with your current CRM and post your leads in real time directly into your CRM as well.</p>
