We have a multi-tiered marketing structure that is developed for each of our customers depending on their budget and their needs.   we organically grow our leads as well as call on leads that have gone on the internet and shown an interest in obtaining a reverse mortgage. This method brings the immediate goal of getting customers whom are in the market now for a reverse mortgage but might be talking to other loan officers, as well as the truly exclusive organic leads that we produce from a method of bringing a solution to their financial problems or imbalance which provides a lead that is not working with anyone else allowing you  to collect the higher margins and make more commissions when you are not in compaction with anyone else and you have truly have an exclusive lead.</p>
